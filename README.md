# pyGuesser

This was created for a intro class that taught Python in Novemeber of 2020. The original goal
was to show various functions of python learned throughout and showed in some sort of program, 
no matter how simple of complex it was. In order for me to show that I rewrote the LetsGuess-project
that is featured on my profile from Java to Python.

## pyguesser.py
Main file to be ran. Prompts the user how many numbers to be guessed, and gives a person three attempts per each
number (between 0-9). If the user can guess all the numbers, else if they arent they are told to try again. Regardless,
the results are saved to a file, pyGuesserResults.txt, that shows what each number was and if the person who attempted
to guess them did so successfully or not. 

## guesservar.py
These are variables used in the pyguesser.py file, and are mainly functions that are used within. Cannot be used alone, and
must be used with main file.
